# Project Title

This project is a **Text Generation system built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**.  
The model learns patterns from textual data and generates new, coherent text based on a given seed input.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Text generation is an important application of **Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
In this project, an LSTM model is trained to predict the next word/character in a sequence and generate text iteratively.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning
   - Tokenization
   - Sequence creation and padding

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Embedding Layer
   - LSTM Layer(s)
   - Dense layer with Softmax activation

3. **Model Training**
   - Learns language structure from input text

4. **Text Generation**
   - Accepts a seed sentence
   - Predicts and generates the next words sequentially
